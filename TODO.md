# todo

## general
* messages css
* footer always at bottom of page

## report/daily
* for the aside, make it an include and put it on the page in specific places

* ideally -- right works as a toc, highlighting current active link user is on and scrolling with them.
* sort on low/high price?
* add a way to collapse sections? html tag?

## commodities
* can i make a way to combine json files for ytd into one? that would be huge, modify `get_report`...
* click on a date in the chart and get sent to that position in the table...


main thing that's left:
* combine json files on `get_report`
* for the aside, make it an include and put it on the page in specific places
